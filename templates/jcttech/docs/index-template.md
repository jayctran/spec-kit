## How This Index Works

This file tracks all GitHub issues related to this project's spec-driven workflow:

### Hierarchy Structure

```
Epic (#N)                         [Type: Epic]
  └── Spec (#N)                   [Type: Spec]
        └── Story (#N)            [Type: Story]
              └── [ ] Task        (checkbox in Story body)
              └── Bug (#N)        [Type: Bug]
```

### Sync Behavior

- **Auto-sync**: Index updates after `/jcttech.epic`, `/jcttech.push`, `/jcttech.plan`
- **Manual sync**: Run `/jcttech.sync` to catch external changes

### Cached Content

Individual issues are cached in `.specify/issues/cache/` for offline reference.

### Draft Tracking

Drafts in `.specify/drafts/` are listed here until pushed to GitHub.
